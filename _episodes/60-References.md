#Other HPC clusters that Griffith users can access

##QRIScloud Special Offering

QRIScloud offers special nodes to Griffith users.

To request a special node, please follow this <a href="https://www.qriscloud.org.au/index.php/services/compute" target="_blank">link</a> and select "Use specialised compute"

In general, you have a question or problem regarding special nodes on QRIScloud, please raise a new QRIScloud support request by emailing support@qriscloud.org.au. For further support options, please visit https://www.qriscloud.org.au/support.

##Flashlite node
This is a large memory cluster named <a href="https://www.qriscloud.org.au/index.php/services/compute#FlashLite" target="_blank">Flashlite</a> (large memory and fast disks in a non-virtualized environment). FlashLite is a research computer that has been designed and optimised for data intensive computing. FlashLite will support applications that need large amounts of primary memory along with very high performance secondary memory. Each of the 68 nodes of FlashLite is equipped with 512 Gbytes of main memory and 4.8TB of solid-state drive (SSD). The operating software supports various programming paradigms including message passing (MPI), shared memory (OpenMP), and virtual symmetric multiprocessor (vSMP). The vSMP mode aggregates nodes to produce virtual machines with very large "main" memory address space.

##Large memory node
QRIScloud operates a small number of compute nodes that can accommodate instances with up to 1TB memory. These can be made available in blocks of time of two weeks as instances with up to 60 vCPUs and 900Gb of memory. Instances can be provisioned with large storage volumes to hold working data.

##GPU node
QRIScloud operates a small number of compute nodes that contain a Tesla K20m GPU. These can be made available in blocks of time of two weeks as instances. Instances can be provisioned with storage volumes to hold working data.

##Elastic compute
Normal Nectar resources are often in short supply, leading to problems with launching instances. QRIScloud has set aside some limited capacity to allow users to create instances with large numbers of vCPUs with a relatively short (up to 7 days) lifetime (elastic compute).

##QCIF's share of NCI
QCIF has a share in time on Raijin and is accepting applications all year round. To request QCIF's share of NCI, follow this <a href="https://www.qriscloud.org.au/index.php/services" target="_blank">link</a> and select "Apply for QCIF's NCI share "

##National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)
The National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme (NCMAS) provides researchers with access to Australia’s major national computational facilities, including Raijin. The main call for applications is made annually in October for allocations to start the following January for up to 12 months.

Australia’s national research computing service, the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), provides world-class, high-end services to Australia’s researchers, the primary objectives of which are to raise the ambition, impact, and outcomes of Australian research through access to advanced, computational and data-intensive methods, support, and high-performance infrastructure.

NCI's peak system,Raijin, is a Fujitsu Primergy high-performance, distributed-memory cluster which entered production use in June 2013. It comprises more than 50,000 cores (Intel Xeon Sandy Bridge technology, 2.6 GHz), 160 TBytes of main memory, Infiniband FDR interconnect and 10 PBytes of usable fast filesystem (for short-term scratch space).The unit of shared memory parallelism is the node, which comprises dual 8-core Intel Xeon (Sandy Bridge 2.6 GHz) processors, i.e., 16 cores. The memory specification across the nodes is heterogeneous in order to provide a configuration capable of accommodating the requirements of most applications, and providing also for large-memory jobs. Raijin is particular suited to large scale MPI jobs which use less than 2GB per core and require low latency interconnects.

##Pawsey Supercomputing Centre
The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre operates multiple supercomputers, data-intensive machines and storage systems that use the most advanced technologies available. The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre supports researchers in Western Australia and across the nation with an array of capabilities encompassing supercomputing, data and visualisation services. To gain access to the resources of the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, to find out about training or to receive help with an issue, please visit the Pawsey User Portal page
